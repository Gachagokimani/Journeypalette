     Wildlife plays a vital role in providing ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling.Animals often feature in folklore, stories, and as national symbols, reflecting their importance to our African culture. As human populations expand, conflicts with wildlife can and do  occur, leading to challenges in coexistence but in our case we have dedicated wildlife service that see that the boundary between human and animals is respected which also plays a huge role in the efforts to quell poaching which is detrimental to the existence of wildlife as a whole.Wildlife Tourism- This can be a significant source of revenue for conservation but must be managed to ensure it doesn’t harm the animals or their habitats but help at conserving efforts that aim to see that this precious resource are harnessed in the best way both benefiting the environment and biodiversity that is accorded to us by mother nature. </p1>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold; fontsize=xx-large">CONSERVATION EFFORTS </h1>
  <h3>Many species are endangered due to habitat loss attributed to climate change which also plays a crucial role in the migration of human beings and animals alike ,Changes in climate can lead to shifts in wildlife populations and behaviors, affecting biodiversity, coupled with poaching which claims the lives of over animals per year, at what price? The mere thrill of taking Aging tasks from their majestic owners case in point over the last year due to the Tanzania having implemented legislation that allowed the hunting for game which led to the loss of life ti one of Africans most prominent Elephant… who not only took the record for having the longest task ever but also being the oldest elephant alive at the time. Conservation efforts aim to protect these species and their habitats which not only plays a crucial role in keeping the balance of life but also serving as the source of livelihood for thousands of communities as well as at JourneyPalette where our chief goal is sustainable development of our culture and bio-diversity.</h3>       <h1>A collection of views from airplanes</h1>
